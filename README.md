## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDb, EJS
Simple image was used in CSS to provide it with a suitable background image. EJS was used to render an html page with JS so it could get and/or post any data from the database.

## Lessons Learned
I learned how to incorporate MongoDB to connect to a database. I also learned how to use the express module with NodeJS to help with creating the server.
